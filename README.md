# Welcome to the Future Habitability Mapping Project

This website was made by Sam Hoag, Jake Fales, Dylan Hauck, Trish Gatsi, Matt Gu, and Kyle Baker for Dr. Vargas-Perez's CS-490: Computing for Environmental Science course at Kalamazoo College during the Fall 2021 Quarter.

Web design done by Dylan Hauck and Kyle Baker, map work done by myself, and data collected and formatted by Jake Fales. Trish Gatsi and Matt Gu helped facilitate these processes in various ways and conducted additional research to aid the project.
